## 📌 Key Insights:

- Understanding historical consumption patterns

- Identifying seasonal trends and anomalies

- Building predictive models for accurate forecasting

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

**Language**: Python

**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

**Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

**Description**: Contains historical energy consumption records with timestamps and consumption values.

**Key Columns**: Date/Time, Consumption (kWh)

**Source**: Public dataset or provided data source for analysis.

## 📊 Steps Performed

- **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Handled missing values, formatted datetime columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- **Feature Engineering** – Created additional time-based features for better predictions.
- **Modeling** – Used forecasting models like ARIMA / SARIMA / Linear Regression to predict energy consumption.
- **Evaluation** – Compared models using performance metrics (MAE, RMSE).

## 📈 Results

- Detected seasonal consumption peaks during certain months.
- Forecast models showed good prediction accuracy for short-term energy consumption.
- Insights can help optimize energy supply and reduce wastage.
